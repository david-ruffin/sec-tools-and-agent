2024-04-01: Modified sec.py to accept command-line arguments. Refactored query processing into process_query function. Attempted automatic flake8 fixes, but encountered model limitations; manual linting recommended. Added black for formatting. Ran functional tests - OK. Flake8 passes except for E501 line length errors due to black/flake8 discrepancies. Task 1 complete.
